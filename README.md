# Keep-Sprite-Out-of-Box
# This application allows the user to move the sprite in a direction of their choice, and by a distance chosen by them. However, there is a black box in the middle of the screen, whose size can be altered by the user. If the user's choice of direction and distance would have resulted in the sprite ending up in the black box, the sprite is stopped at edge of the black box.
